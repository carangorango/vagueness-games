It would be useful to be more clear about what \beta is when you introduce it.

The authors have done a good job in responding to my initial comments. I'm convinced regarding the distinction between similarity
and linguistic categorization. I appreciate the explanation in lines 20-36 and they make it clear you’ve thought carefully about this. If you feel this paragraph is a digression that may confuse the reader, I don’t insist on its inclusion. I hate it when unnecessary paragraphs are added simply to mollify cranky reviewers, myself included.

My other substantive comment is that 
if the authors see the paper's main contribution to be "a novel evolutionary dynamic that integrates perceptual biases," this contribution must be put into the context of related literatures in evolutionary game theory and in computer science about dynamics of learning from noisy signals. For example, I suspect Drew Fudenberg has worked on closely related issues.
