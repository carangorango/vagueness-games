Dear Jeff,

our paper "Vagueness, Noise, and Signaling" was finally rejected after three rounds of reviewing (see email below). We are aware that such comebacks are to be frowned upon, but: 

We have finished a completely made-over descendant of our previous submission. The original motivation, the main argumentative thrust and the main conclusions are still largely the same, but the formal parts are entirely replaced by a thorough derivation of a novel dynamic from "first principles," just like a previous reviewer wanted to see. The paper is leaner and the formal elements are much more straightforward. We would like to ask if Philosophy of Science would allow a new submission.

Our work on this project profited from the resources of Philosophy of Science, so it seems reasonable and fair to at least ask whether the journal would like to consider the new paper.

We apologize if this seems utterly inappropriate. The editorial decision letter gave no indication as to why exactly the previous paper was found "not well suited for publication in Philosophy of Science" eventually. Our best guess is that it was too technical and the technical part did not fully convince one of the reviewers. The paper's descendant is improved in both respects. If we guessed wrongly, we are happy to hear it. 

Thank you for your time & advice.

Best wishes,
Michael & Pedro.
